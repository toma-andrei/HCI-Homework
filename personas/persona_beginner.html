            <h5>Detailed Description</h5>
            <p>
              Marius is a student at the Faculty of Psychology and Education. He
              choosed this field because he wanted a bachelor's degree but with
              a medium amount of work. His parents are not happy with his choice
              because this field is not suitable for him. After one year and a
              half of faculty he agreed with his parents and tried to to find a
              new study field. He heard from friends that computer science is a
              very well paid field. From internet finds out about INFOX and
              immediately got on the app. For the first touch he just wanted to
              see how the problems are like but the only thing he could do was
              to create an account. Marius created the account and after a few
              seconds he was able to see the app. First he got to his profile
              page and updated his account. Because of history in video games
              student got used immediately with the interface. Because of the
              multitude of chapters and problems, Marius got really confused but
              finally managed to choose a problem. The problem was a very easy
              one but he was not able to solve it because of his poor computer
              science knowledge. <br />
              Because of low determination and lack of a good mentor, the boy
              got descuraged and left the app, looking for other field to study.

            Marius tries to choose a problem to solve but have a hard time
            choosing a chapter to solve a problem from because of low knowledge
            of computer science curriculum.

            Marius finally manages to choose a problem, the one with simple
            requirements but was not able to solve the problem because of low
            knowledge in mathematics and computer science.
