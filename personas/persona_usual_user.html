            <h5>Detailed Description</h5>
            <p>
              Since she was a child, Ligia loved to play video games of any
              genre. Because of this, she got a skill in addapting with any type
              of user interface. In general school she begins to like informatic
              fields because of her kins, not much older than her, who are
              learning in computer science related fields. <br />
              Nowadays, in highschool, Ligia is looking for a problem solving
              app to learn an useful programming language. From her teachers
              finds out about INFOX. <br />Because of her past in gaming, Ligia
              get easly familiar with the UI. Problems requirements are very
              clear because these are verified by admin and the information
              architecture is good. The things she doesn't like are that there
              are too many chapters in the list and get easly lost and problem
              hints must be bought with "app currency", which create some sort
              of fear of not having coins. She want to give feedback to an admin
              about all this but app infrastructure does not allow it.

          <p>
            Ligia was asked by the teacher to solve 3 problems from chapter
            dinamically alocated list. She gets on the app but finds out that
            this chapter does not contains problems. She was announced about
            this by a specific message.
          </p>

          <p>
            Ligia finds a problem similar with one she solved few days ago but
            can't remember how it has to be solved. She navigate to solved
            problem and reload the old solution. She was asked through a modal
            if she is sure about this.

          <p>
            Ligia wants to change her background color. She navigates to profile
            settings but she cannot find her prefferate color. She wants to tell
            admin to add a color picker to the app for selecting background
            color.

            The girl submitted a solution for a problem and waits for it to be
            verified. While waiting, a colorful loading component is shown.
            After solution verification, her score was available in the problem
            solution history.
