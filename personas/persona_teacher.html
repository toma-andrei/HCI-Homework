            <h5>Detailed Description</h5>
            <p>
              Petru is a teacher at a highschool in rural area. At this highschool,
              students don't pay much attention to informatics related courses until this year. <br />
              A small  group of students asked him if he could guide them to learn C/C++.
              Petru was happy to hear about this and search for a good way of guiding them. From 
              a friend he found a website, INFOX, that has a lot of problems and exercises about C/C++ 
              from a friend of him but also a way of managing homeworks and progress of all students at once. 
              Because of automatic problem solution verification, teacher decided that is enough for him to guide students only theoretical
              when they find a dead end so is not really necessary for him to learn C/C++. <br/>
              First time on the website, Petru had a hard time finding how to create a class and how to add its students to it because 
              of lack of experience with UIs. After creating the class and adding students, he once again fight with the interface to find 
              how to send homeworks and how to follow his students progress. <br/>
              After a while of using INFOX and some frustrations, Petru got used to interface and now is easy for him to use it. 
              His life would be easier if there was a help page for this operations but because of developers thought that everything is
              placed naturally, they didn't add a help page.

          <h5>Scenarios</h5>
         <p>Petru get on the website, create an account (this was easy for him because he has to complete a classic form). 
           On the first touch with the interface he had a hard time finding the button for creating a class. 
           This button was naturally palced on the right top of the screen, in the user profile menu.  
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>Petru tries to add his students, who already created accounts. He asked them to send him a message of their usernames.
              Having his students username, teached easly added them to class, adding students usernames in a text field.
